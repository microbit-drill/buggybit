# buggybit
Xmas 2016 play and learn with the kids

# Play and learn
Some aspects
- just play with the buggy
- linefollowing: how to have fun with this (micro:bit sumai wrestling, push out of the circle)
- ultrasonic addition: distance and time
- fun with micro:bit controller: GUI with some leds and and 2 buttons

## Hardware

### Kitronic buggy with line follower for micro:bit

- Button A/B avaiable (I/O ?)
- P1/2 I/O available

#### Line following kit
- https://www.kitronik.co.uk/2125-lf-line-following-add-on-board-for-laser-tank.html
- Uses P1/2 

### Ultrasonic module
- pulse echo and +5v

## Software
- To be deceided

## Problems to be solved

### Pins
Which pins for pulse echo and interface resistors for the 3/5v interfacing micro:bit<->Ultransonic module

### Bluetooth
micro:bit to micro:bit comunication: pairing and all that jazz

### Finishing!
Some form of closure to each part of the project
- micro:bit controller GUI as a probable need first
- ultrasonic hardware interfacing

## GUI
micro:bit as a GUI to control the buggy and the aspects of user interface
